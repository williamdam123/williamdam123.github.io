### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 2
  This part of lab 3 was interesting to me because I've always been very interested in knowing how a date difference conversion could calculate the number of days between two dates. I was able to write the proper code for this conversion and it ran through perfectly. After I ran it, I was asked to input a start date and an end date for the program to calculate the number of days between those two dates as the output. I was allowed to calculate the number of days between any two dates that I could input a date that is very far back into the past and a date that's very far into the future like the year 250,000 and still get the expected output.

* Lab 4, part 2
  This was my second favorite lab because of how simple the guessing game really is. This 2-player game meant one player had to guess the secret number the other player had in mind using only two guesses. Whether you guess the number right or wrong using one or two guesses, every turn, you would switch between being the guesser and the picker. Everytime when it's my program's turn to guess, it would keep on getting guesses higher than the secret number. My guess is the real person online picked numbers that are too small.

* Lab 10, part 2
  Last but not least, I also liked this part of lab 10 as it deals with populations of densities (in this case, it's counties). I wrote this program to get to know how many people lived in my county as well as nearby counties. I'm curious to know what position Orange County is in in terms of population.
